# homomorphic_db
[ACADEMIC]

This project implements a basic simple database system, using homomorphic encryption.

Admin: The admin is the program that installs all the application dependencies. Creates for every entity their respective key pairs.

Client: The API that allows each user to create a table, insert/delete a row, and querie each table.

Server: The program responsible for maintaining the database and do all the homomorphic related operations.

NOTE: Each of these programs has it's own Readme.md file on the corresponding folder and has the actions of each program explained in detail.
NOTE2: This is just for DEMO purposes. It is actually incomplete, so any undefined behaviours are to be expected.
