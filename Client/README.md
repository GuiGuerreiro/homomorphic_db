# User
Requirements: This program requires you to install the CMake version at least 3.12 which can be done following this website https://cmake.org/download/, and also the SEAL Microsoft Library for Homomorphic encryption, at least version 3.4, which can be done following the guide on this website https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL.

## Description: This program gives the user the ability to perform actions on the database.
 Such as:
 - CREATE TABLE "tablename" ("col1","col2","...")
 - INSERT INTO "tablename" ("col1","col2","...") VALUES ("val1","val2","...")
 1. SELECT LINE "rownumber" FROM "tablename"
    -DELETE "linenum" FROM "tablename"
 - SELECT "colx" FROM "tablename" WHERE "colx" <|>|= "value"
 
Every value is encrypted homomorphically before being sent to the server, unsuring that the server never gets access to the values stored in it.
The command to the server is also RSA encrypted.
Every file generated by the user is signed with its private key.

Usage: To run this program first it is need to generate a make file using a CMake command, then compile the program using this make file and run the program.
- cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/mylibs
- make
- sudo python3 client.py
